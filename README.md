Colourful Critter Quest is an educational children's game that teaches kids ages 2-10 to recognize
 and spell animals, basic colour theory, and simple mathematical calculations. Through a combination of
 entertainment and education. Each of the three topic modules includes at least three different levels: the lowest
 levels contain multiple choice questions, while the higher level questions require users to spell and type out the
 answers. After each game session, users can save the levels they have already completed. Allowing users to progress 
 throughout the game, reviewing words, calculations, and colour theories they have already learned while learning new 
 concepts.
